\section{Summary}
\explanationdetail {
	\begin{flushleft}
		\setlength{\parindent} {4ex}
		\hspace{\parindent} I'm a Software Engineer with more than 5 years of
		experience writing and deploying high performance systems into
		production with Rust, with a focus on driving hardware devices. I have a
		proven track record of debugging hard to reproduce hardware/software
		issues and communicating root causes and solutions effectively. I've
		successfully taken four projects from inception to production on time,
		helping coordinate and organize the respective teams.  I have strong
		communication skills, and pride myself in speaking to others with candor
		and compassion.

		I'm a mostly self-taught programmer, and I enjoy working on code that is
		performance sensitive and/or close to hardware.

		The most important aspects of work to me are effective communication,
		learning opportunities, individual and team ownership, value-based
		culture, and an interesting product.

\section{Experience}
\datedexperience{Nixpkgs}{2020--Present}
\explanation{Maintainer}
\explanationdetail{
	\coloredbullet\ I maintain binutils, firefox, thunderbird, beets,
	bindfs, and more
}
\datedexperience{Standard Cognition}{2018--Present}
\explanation{Systems Engineer}
\explanationdetail{
	\coloredbullet\ I started as a summer intern and was promoted to a full
	time Software Engineer.\par
	\coloredbullet\ My initial role at Standard was working on the camera and
	imaging stack, where I built the software that operates all cameras
	across their sites, managing upwards of 100Gb/s of image data with only
	on-site processing.\par
	\coloredbullet\ I transitioned into helping migrate the code that defined
	the data pipeline from Python to Rust, eliminating years of
	technical debt in the process.\par
	\coloredbullet\ I spearheaded a company-wide requirements
	gathering in order to understand our data needs. This evolved into a
	project to create better internal data engineering tools, which I
	worked on until 2020.\par
	\coloredbullet\ I helped review the acquisition of another
	company, where I was responsible for analyzing their stack and
	detecting possible issues during integration, as well as licensing
	issues.\par
	\coloredbullet\ I implemented a successful engineering-wide RFC
	process.\par
	\coloredbullet\ I debugged numerous hardware issues with cameras and
	worked with the vendor on developing and deploying fixes.\par
	\coloredbullet\ I helped bring Rust to the entire engineering team,
	taking us from my initial $\approx 2000$ LOC project to almost
	$60\,000$ lines of Rust company-wide.\par
}
\datedexperience{Hangar}{2015--2018}
\explanation{Founder}
\explanationdetail {
	\coloredbullet\ I helped co-found Hangar, one of the first makerspaces
	in Brazil.\par
	\coloredbullet\ While active, I helped grow the organization from 3 to
	more than 30 members and held workshops on C, robotics, and Rust.
}
\datedexperience{Async Open Source}{2014--2016 Summers}
\explanation{Intern}
\explanationdetail {
	\coloredbullet\ I developed an application that helped customers easily migrate
	their databases to Postgres.\par
	\coloredbullet\ I migrated our application to mobile using Cordova.\par
	\coloredbullet\ I helped fix and triage many bugs in our usage of PyGTK.\par
