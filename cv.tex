\datedexperience{AWS}{2022--Present}
\explanation{Senior Software Engineer  2023--Present}
\explanationdetail{
	\coloredbullet\ Lead developer for the BTLX (Builder Tools Language Experience) Rust team, in charge of the experience of over 4000 developers using Rust at AWS.\par
	\coloredbullet\ Sole team member to survive the wave of layoffs, taking on the load that was previously shared by a team of $\approx 5$ senior engineers.\par
	\coloredbullet\ Worked closely with the Rust compiler team, acting as the intermediary between Open Source and business needs of Rust at Amazon.\par
	\coloredbullet\ Drove various improvements to the Rust experience at Amazon, leading to many billions of dollars saved in engineering time and build infrastructure costs.\par

\explanation{Software Engineer  2022--2023}
\explanationdetail{
	\coloredbullet\ Worked on CargoBrazil, the integration between Cargo and
	Amazon's internal build system, Brazil.\par
	\coloredbullet\ Held the weekly Nix office hours, helping hundreds of
	developers become productive with Nix in the process.\par

\datedexperience{Standard Cognition}{2018--2021}
\explanation{AI Systems Software Engineer}
\explanationdetail{
	\coloredbullet\ Initially worked on the camera and imaging stack, where I
	built the software that operates all cameras across their sites, managing
	upwards of 100Gb/s of image data with only on-site processing.\par
	\coloredbullet\ Transitioned into helping migrate data pipeline code from
	Python to Rust, eliminating years of technical debt.\par
	\coloredbullet\ Spearheaded a company-wide requirements gathering in order to
	understand our data needs. This evolved into a project to create better
	internal data engineering tools, which I worked on until 2020.\par
	\coloredbullet\ Helped review the acquisition of another company, where I was
	responsible for analyzing their stack and detecting possible issues during
	integration, as well as licensing issues.\par
	\coloredbullet\ Implemented a successful engineering-wide RFC process.\par
	\coloredbullet\ Debugged numerous hardware issues with cameras and worked
	with the vendor on developing and deploying fixes.\par
	\coloredbullet\ Helped bring Rust to the entire engineering team, taking us
	from my initial $\sim 2000$ LoC project to almost $60\,000$ lines of Rust
	company-wide.\par
