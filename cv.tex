    \datedexperience{Nixpkgs}{2020-Present}
    \explanation{Maintainer}
    \explanationdetail{
        \coloredbullet\ I maintain binutils, firefox, thunderbird, beets,
            bindfs, and more
    }
    \datedexperience{Standard Cognition}{2018-Present}
    \explanation{Systems Engineer}
    \explanationdetail{
        \coloredbullet\ I started as a summer intern and was converted to a full time software Engineer\par
        \coloredbullet\ My initial role at Standard was working on the camera and
            imaging stack, where I built the software that operates all cameras
            across their sites, managing upwards of 100Gb/s of image data\par
        \coloredbullet\ I transitioned into helping migrate the code that defined
            the data pipeline from Python to Rust, eliminating years of
            technical debt in the process\par
        \coloredbullet\ I spearheaded a company-wide requirements
            gathering in order to understand our data needs. This evolved into a
            project to create better internal data engineering tools, which I
            worked on until 2020\par
        \coloredbullet\ I helped review the acquisition of another
            company, where I was responsible for analyzing their stack and
            detecting possible issues during integration, as well as licensing
            issues\par
        \coloredbullet\ I implemented a successful engineering-wide RFC
            process\par
        \coloredbullet\ I debugged numerous hardware issues with cameras and
            worked with the vendor on developing and deploying fixes.\par
        \coloredbullet\ I helped bring Rust to the entire engineering team,
            taking us from my initial $\approx 2000$ LOC project to almost
            $60\,000$ lines of Rust company-wide.\par
    }
    \datedexperience{Hangar}{2015-2018}
    \explanationdetail {
        \coloredbullet\ I helped co-found Hangar, one of the first makerspaces
            in Brazil\par
        \coloredbullet\ While active, I helped grow the organization from 3 to
            more than 30 members and held workshops on C, robotics, and Rust
